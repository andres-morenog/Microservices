# Online - Shop University of Antioquia

In Order to mitigate the economical crisis that faces the public education, the University of Antioquia plans to open an online shop
in which it will sell different products such as books,bags and many more.
After a meeting with the members of the directive board, several features wished for the online-shop were identified. This features will allow : 
- Sell the products on the internet.
  - Simulate a cart that is similiar to the supermarket cart.
  - Create the order to be shipped.
  - Pay the products.
- Offer the products on the internet.
- Add products to the store.
- Manage the inventory.
- Ship the products to the customer.
- Manage the accounting and taxes.

One of this features it's the catalog. It's required that the visitors of the online-shop can have a look to all the products so that they can decide which one of them they want to buy.

To ensure that the product that the user is buying is available it's also required to have an inventory. It's also wished that the user can place several products in one purchase order. 
To finish a purchase order the user must have an account in which all the payment information, general information and the purchase history will be saved.

The developer team proposes to solve this problem using an architecture based on microservices.
